**Bio:** 

In 2005, I received B.Eng. degree in computer science from *Faculte des sciences Tunis* (Tunis, Tunisia). From 2005 to 2015 I worked at STMicroelectronis Tunis as senior design application engineer. I am currently working as a Master student in Computer Engineering at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, Canada).
