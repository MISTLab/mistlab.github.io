# + Christophe Marcel Trouillefou

I am developping an autonomous biological experiment into a mini-incubator in microgravity. I am on a postdoc here at MIST Lab at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC).

I own a Bachelor in Environmental Engineering (Université de Provence, Marseille), a Master in Environmental Analytical Chemistry and Waste Management (Université Paul Cézanne, Marseille), a Master in Materials Sciences option Thin or Divided Materials (Université de Provence, Marseille), and a PhD in Material Sciences applied Environment (Montpellier SupAgro, Institut Charles Gerhardt, Montpellier).

My research interests are generally related to the environment. I was previously involved in a few projects about:<br>
_ Geophysics on an underground polluted with hydrocarbons<br>
_ Diagnosis: State of dangerous pesticides in a drainage basin<br>
_ Elimination of pharmaceutical traces in different wastewaters<br>
_ Enzymes encapsulation into nanoporous materials

## + Current Projects

- My project is to grow a leguminous plant (*Medicago truncatula*) into an incubator that we are designing here also. This experiment will be held in a 3U CubeSat in microgravity. The main objectives are: (1) Growing plants in an autonomous way; (2) Learn to control a mutable environment through a total life cycle of a plant, from seed to seed, and in microgravity.
