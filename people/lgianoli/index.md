# + Luca Giovanni Gianoli

I received the Master Degree in Telecommunications Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano][6] in 2010. In 2014, co-supervised by Prof. A. Capone and Prof. B. Sansò, I obtained a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at both [Politecnico di Milano][6] and [Polytechnique Montreal][7] with a thesis on energy-aware network management in IP networks.
Before becoming a post-doctoral researcher at [MIST][8] (Polytechnique Montreal) under the supervision of Prof. Giovanni Beltrame and Prof. G. Nicolescu, I had held the same position at [LORLAB][9] (Polytechnique Montreal) for 18 months (directed by Prof. B. Sansò).
My research interests include network optimization, operations research, robust optimization, cloud computing and networking. 

Besides my research activity, I also love tennis, soccer, running, cooking and reading. In 2015, I concluded the Montreal's marathon at the 34-th place in 2h59m.
## + Current Projects

My post-doctoral research is focused on:
- optimization of ad-hoc networks in disaster recovery scenarios;
- topology optimization in swarm robotics.

## + Scholarship and Awards

- In 2015, supported by Prof. B. Sansò and Prof. E. Delage, I was chosen among the two candidates who were granted  a 6-month Postdoctoral scholarship from the Group for Research in Decision Analysis [(GERAD)][5]
