I received my B.Sc. degree in Aerospace Engineering from Cairo University and a M.Sc. degree in Aerospace Engineering from the same university. My background includes control and guidance, system modeling and simulation, parameter identification and estimation, robot networks and good experience with design and fabrication (using CAD tools, hardware prototyping and others). I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Engineering at École Polytechnique de Montréal.
