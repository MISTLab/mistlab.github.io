I received my electronics and communication engineering B.Eng. degree from the Danang University of Technology – UD (Vietnam) in 2015. I have been a Master student in electronics and computer engineering from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (Taipei) since 2016. Currently I am doing a research internship in the MISTLab - a robotics laboratory - under the supervision of Prof. Giovanni Beltrame. 
 
In addition to my studies, I am interested in soccer, rock music, travelling and photography. 
 
 
## Current Projects 
 
- Swarm networking: 
   + In this project, swarm robots are used for pattern formation and energy-aware deployment. 
   + I am working on the automatic charging stations which robots can charge from with the preservation of the desired pattern formation in the self-adaptive network. 
 
 
## Scholarship and Awards 
 
- I have been a recipient of the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology Scholarship for Master degree in 2016 and 2017. 
- I also received the Polytechnique Montréal for my research internship.
