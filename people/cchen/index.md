**Bio:** 

In 2008, I received B.Eng. degree with First Class Honours in EEE from *University of Strathclyde* (Glasgow, UK). I also received B.Sc. degree in EEE from *North China Electric Power University* (Beijing, China). In 2013, I was awarded the M.Sc. degree in Communications Engineering at *RWTH Aachen University* (Aachen, Germany). I am currently working as a PhD student in Computer Engineering at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, Canada). My research interests include embedded system modeling, probabilistic software timing analysis and multi-processor system-on-chip design.

**Current Projects**

My doctoral research focuses on probabilistic timing analysis. For high-performance time-critical aerospace computer system, such as a satellite, the accurate timing prediction of software execution plays an important role. However, to address increasing complexity in computer applications, more advanced architectures using multi-stage pipelines, several memory hierarchy levels and even Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) designs are proposed for high performance computing. These traditional deterministic computer architectures make software timing behavior almost impossible to accurately predict. A conservative estimation will place the Worse Case Execution Time (WCET) far away from the actual maximum time used by the application. In this research project, I address the issue using probabilistic real-time system software. The idea is that the timing behavior of a system can be defined by probabilistic metrics applied to software. With probabilistic software methodology for timing prediction, the execution time will have a smoother distribution and avoid corner cases. This will reduce overestimation and time-critical system can benefit tremendous in terms of cost of integration, verification and certification.
