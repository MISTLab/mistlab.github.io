## + Vivek Shankar Varadharajan

I am a roboticist and a researcher trying to understand, apply and evolve the concepts in robotics. In 2015, I received my M.Sc. degree in Automation and Robotics with a master thesis on **An Aspiration set approach to an Orientering TSP** under the supervision of Prof. Günter Rudolph from Technical University of Dortmund (Dortmund, Germany), I received my bachlors degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from Bannari Amman Institute of Technology, Anna University  (Tamil Nadu, India) in 2012. At present, I am a Ph.D. student in computer engineering at the *MIST Labs, École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, Canada). My research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, distributed robotics and Cyber-Physical systems.

Apart from my study, I love swimming and I do swimming in my time off.

I am always looking forward to new collaborations, if you find any of my work interesting and you wish to collaborate, feel free to write to me.

## + Current Projects

- Buzz in ROS [ROSBuzz] [4] **Creating a ROS package for Buzz**:

ROSBuzz focuses on extending Buzz in ROS. Buzz is a heterogeneous programming language for programming a swarm of robots. It provides a means for coordinated task accomplishment with a swarm of Robots. The focus of this project is to implement Buzz Virtual machine (BVM) as a ROS Package. Current work on ROSBuzz focuses on testing the built package with state-of-the-art algorithms on a fleet of heterogeneous drone swarms. The drone swarm constitutes 3DR solos and DJI Matrix 100.

- Updatable Buzz **Dynamically updating rules for the swarm after deployment**:

Updatable Buzz is about building an updatable BVM. The focus of this project is to achieve continuous integration in a fleet of robots performing coordinated task. The main bottleneck of creating an update for a swarm, while in operation is to reach a consensus agreement.  

- A distributed data storage mechanism **SOUL: data sharing for robot swarms**:

One of the main problems in designing distributed algorithms is that large amount of data has to be transported from one node to multiple others in a reliable manner, to utilize the full potential of the distribution. This project focuses on designing and exploring methods for efficient data storage and transport in robot swarms and distributed nodes.

- An approach to environmental model for robot swarms **Distributed planning for robot swarms with an environmental model**:

Environment is generally hostile for robot, there are several factor influencing the control of robots. In design of any control algorithm a nose factor is taken into consideration. If the robots are given a map of hazards for a given environment they are planning to navigate, they can effectively plan and avoid these pitfalls. This project focuses on developing methods to effectively model the environment for planned task execution.    

- My doctoral research is focused on **Software eco-system for long-term autonomy in robot swarms**:

There exists a software ecosystem (App store) for smart phones and tablets, with which the end user can utilize the hardware capabilities of a phone to perform the assigned task just with a click (installing). Similarly, a reliable and easy configurable software ecosystem is to be created to exploit the capabilities of a swarm of autonomous robots. This could take a leap and make the swarm to be deployable in real world scenarios to accomplish magnanimous tasks by an user with limited knowledge.
