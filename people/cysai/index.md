I am a PhD student from University of Malaya and joined MIST Lab as research intern in 2019. I have received my Bachelor Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Hons) from The National University of Malaysia and Bachelor of Science from University of Duisburg Essen, Germany, both in 2014. I have worked as research assistant in Applied Control and Robotics Laboratory, ACRLAB in University of Malaya from 2015 to 2016. I am keen to explore the potential of human brain and contribute to the advancement of science and technology in the future. My research interests are EEG signal processing and machine learning.
