# + Bianca Angotti

I am studying to complete my degree in Computer Software Engineering (Co-op) at the *University of Alberta* (Edmonton, AB). For my third work term, I am an intern here at MIST Lab at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC) as I was interested in learning about swarm robotics. 

In addition to my studies, I am involved in the Autonomous Robotics Vehicle Project ([ARVP][2]) at the *University of Alberta*. ARVP strives to promote and develop robotic technology to current and future generations. They are currently working on a new autonomous underwater robot that will compete in the International RoboSub competition in San Diego, California. 

## + Current Projects

- I was tasked with designing and implementing a virtual arena for testing swarm robotics algorithms. This includes a tracking system with an overhead camera, communication and control for the robots, and a simulator-in-the-loop step to emulate sensors or actuators that do not exist on the real robots. 

## + Scholarship and Awards

- In 2015 and 2016, I received the Jason Lang Scholarship from the University of Alberta.
- In 2014, I received the Faculty of Engineering Academic Excellence Scholarship and University of Alberta Academic Excellence Scholarship.
