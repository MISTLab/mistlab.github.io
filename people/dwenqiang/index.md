I received my M.Eng. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent system from Shenyang Institute of Automation, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(SIA, UCAS)  in 2019 and received my B.Eng. degree in Mechanical design manufacturing and automation from Anhui University(AHU, China) in 2016. My research interests include SLAM, Swarm Robotics Perception, Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in computer engineering at the *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, Canada). 

In addition to my studies, I like hiking, running, swimming and playing billiard.
