# + Marcel Kaufmann



I received my MSc degree in Photonics and Computer Vision from the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences, Germany, in 2016.
In addition to my studies, I worked as a scientifc software engineer for S[&]T in the Netherlands. As an undergraduate and graduate student, I also provided first aid and life support to people during my assignement as Emergency Medical Technician for the German Red Cross.

## + Current Projects



- My doctoral research focuses on collaborative human and multi-robot systems.
- Also working on a self-adaptive data handling system for cube sats.
