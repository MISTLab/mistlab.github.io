I received my Bachelor degree in computer science from *Institut Supérieur de l'Education et de la Formation Continue* (Tunis, Tunisia) in 2011, The Bachelor degree in mechanical Engineering from *l'Ecole Superieure des Sciences et Techniques de Tunis* (Tunis, Tunisia) in 2003. Currently, I am a Master Degree student (thesis option) in computer engineering at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, Canada).

## + Current Project

My research is focused on **realization of a system for measuring the temperature and validation of a thernmal model**:
Today’s computer systems are growing more and more. The power consumed by the processors due to increased number of cores is dissipated as heat causing thermal problems, malfunction of the circuit and reduce the duration of life. Our work is to setup a system of measurement by infrared thermography witch will be used to capture the distribution of temperature and power dissipation of the chip under test. The data collected by our proposed system will be used to validate tha accuracy of performance of many thermal models.
