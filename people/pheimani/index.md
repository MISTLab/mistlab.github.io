I am an undergraduate student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India. My research interests include VLSI and
Machine learning.
 
 ## + Current Projects
My internship project is **Radiation tolerant FPGA Architecture**. 
Reprogrammable FPGA, featuring high flexibility, combined with high performance and complexity become increasingly important for space applications. At the same time, orbital and space based applications are susceptible to the effects of high energy charged particles. Faults affecting fpga's memories are a major dependability threat for these devices. Faults can effectively be removed using configuration scrubbing. It employs Triple module redundancy circuit to detect error and partially reconfigures the desired contents of the memory without interrupting its operation.
