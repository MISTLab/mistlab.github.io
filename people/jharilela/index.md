# + Jayant Harilela

I am an undergrad student in City University of Hong Kong, studying Mechatronic Engineering. I am doing a summer internship in the Mist Lab under the supervision of Dr. Giovanni Beltrame.

## + Current Projects
Building small robots called [Zooids][3] which was originally designed by [Stanford SHAPE Lab][4]. The design is improved by introducing a induction charging coil at the bottom of the zooid for autonomous charging.
