I am a double degree student currently working towards my M.Sc.A in aerospace engineering at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, CANADA). My partner school is *École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne* (Lausanne, SWITZERLAND), where I studied microengineering and robotics and obtained my BSc in 2016.
My topics of interest include *SLAM, machine learning, mobile robotics, computer vision, automatic control and cognitive science*.

## + Previous activities
I have been teaching assistant for different courses at EPFL :
- Analyse I, Prof. Wittwer
- Analyse III, Prof. Metzener
- Probabilités et statistique, Prof. Dehaene
- Probabilités et statistique, Prof. Morgenthaler

I have also been associated with the LASA (Learning algorithms and systems laboratory) at EPFL, in which I was a student research assistant. My work was based on experiments I realized to model the bimanual catching and grasping motions observed in subjects. I was under the supervision of *Sina Mirrazavi* and *Prof. Aude Billard*.

In Montreal, most of the classes I took focused on machine learning and were given by the MILA. I especially had a lot of fun working with my small robot, Count Duckula, in [Duckietown](https://duckietown.org/).
## + Current Projects
- Semantic perception of the environment for multi-robot Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). Semantic elements such as labeled objects can help make SLAM systems more robust, while at the same time compressing information to represent an environment. Moreover, understanding an environment through semantics can allow for complex interactions and tasks.
- I enjoy being a teaching assistant, and I am currently helping help with the labs of two courses : Architecture des micro-ordinateurs of Prof. Beltrame and I.A.:tech. probabilistes et d'apprentissage of Prof. Chris Pal.
