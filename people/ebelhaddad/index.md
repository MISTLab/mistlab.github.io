# + Emir Khaled Belhaddad

I'm a Computer Science student at Polytechnique Montréal.

I'm curious about pretty much everything that touchs computer science. Lately, I was mainly oriented toward web-applications development, but I also like to learn about new things related to hardware technologies. I'm generally a hard-worker, but I like to take time to chat with people form time to time.

## + Current Projects

- I'm currently working with [Anthony Dentinger](https://mistlab.ca/people/adentinger/), a Computer Science B.Eng. student, on [BittyBuzz](https://github.com/MISTLab/BittyBuzz), which is an implementation of the [Buzz programming language](http://the.swarming.buzz/) for microcontrollers. This will allow researchers to perform swarm robotics experiments on large swarms of cheap robots without the need to re-implement swarm-related features. Possible long-term applications include nanorobotics. MISTLab wishes BittyBuzz, if possible, to fit on the ATMega328P microcontroller of a kilobot. The main constraints of this project are the the program space (32KB, including bootloading program) and the RAM size (2KB).
- I'm the team leader of the group in charge of developping the communication protocols for an arm's exoskeleton project in Métis ([website](), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SocieteMetis)).

## + Scholarship

- For the BittyBuzz project, I was chosen as recipient of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)'s [Undergraduate Student Research Award](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp) (USRA).
