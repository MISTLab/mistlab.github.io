# + Pierre-Yves Lajoie  

I received a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Polytechnique Montréal in May 2018 and I am currently a master's student in MIST lab.

## + Current Projects

- Research on multi-robot Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) robust to outlier measurements in order to improve the resilience of robotics systems in GPS-denied environments. My current work is in close collaboration with professor Luca Carlone's research group at the Massachussetts Institude of Technology.
