I began my research in the robotics field by creating a line follower robot, when I was a high school student at the NODET high school in 2006 (National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents [4]). My interest in robotic, motivated and led me to study in Electrical Engineering B.Sc. at the IAUM and continue my education to receive a master's degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the QIAU (degree received in 2018). As a member of the MRL (Mechatronics Research Laboratory [5] under the supervision of the QIAU) and an executive committee member of the Middle Size soccer robots League (MSL) at the RoboCup International Federation [6], I become interested in the field of multi-agent robots. Working in robotics fields from 2006 alongside participating in numerous national and international robotics competitions and also working as an instructor for robotic studies was very instructive for me.
My current research interests are multi-agent perception projects (cooperative localization, tracking and formation strategies).

Apart from my study time, I'm a big fan of soccer and I do playing soccer on my time off.

## + Current Projects
I am exploring the potentialities of multi-agent perception in different environment (from a predefined field like a soccer field to an unknown environment). I currently focused on cooperative tracking in multi-agent perception by using event-based vision.
