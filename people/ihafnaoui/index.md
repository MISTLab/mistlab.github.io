### Bio and Research Interest

I received my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from M'Hamed
Bouguara University (BM, Algeria) in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Electrical
Engineering from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering -IGEE- (BM, Algeria) in 2011. I am currently a PhD student
at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal (QC, Canada) under the supervision
of [Giovanni Beltrame][prof] and a member of the
[MISTLab](http://www.mistlab.ca).
   
In past years, I competed in the LG Global Challenger 2011 as a team leader that ranked among the top five. I also led a team on the Startup Weekend Women edition'12 where we ranked among the top nine.
 
My research interests lay in _Swarm intelligence, Machine Learning, Bio-inspired Optimization Techniques, Pattern Recognition, Embedded Systems, Real-time Scheduling_

### Projects  
* **Current**  

My current projects span multiple fields with application on varied systems such as full-mission simulators, robotic swarms, etc.
A description of these projects can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/imane-hafnaoui/research).


* **Previous**  

**Self-parking Car**    
![img2][]  

I worked previously on an autonomous self-parking car based on SOPC. We built our system on an RC-toy car that detects a parking space, judges the adequacy of said space and then proceeds to park in either parking positions; parallel, or perpendicular. It could also leave a parking space after it was parked. The system was built on the DE2 Altera FPGA board and used the soft-core technology NIOS-II.
