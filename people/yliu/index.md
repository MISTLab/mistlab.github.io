# + Yixiu Liu

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute][1] (Shanghai, China). Currently, I work as a research intern at [MIST Lab][2], [École Polytechnique de Montréal][3] (Montréal, QC, Canada). I'm interested in robotics and control.

In addition to my studies, I enjoy sports including hiking, badminton and tennis. I also participate in keelboat racing with the sailing team of Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## + Current Projects

- I am now working on situated communication for mobile robots. The Khepera will use its infrared sensors to detect the direction and distance of neighboring robots, as well as to recognize their identity. After that, the robots will share information and communicate with each other via Bluetooth. 

## + Scholarship and Awards

- In 2017, I receive a scholarship for the internship at École Polytechnique de Montréal.
- In 2015 and 2016, I received Academic Excellence Scholarship from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
