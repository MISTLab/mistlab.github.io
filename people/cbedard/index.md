# + Christophe Bédard

I graduated with a B.Eng. in mechanical engineering from Polytechnique Montréal in 2017. I'm currently pursuing my interest in computer engineering.

I also like skiing and reading, but not simultaneously.

## + Current Projects

- I am currently working on an automatic charging station for the Khepera IV, which is used in swarm robotics research.
- I am the structures director of the student design team *Élikos* ([website][1], [Facebook][2]). We are developping an autonomous drone to compete in the International Aerial Robotics Competition ([website][3]) every year at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, USA. The main challenge is navigating autonomously in a sterile environment. *Élikos* finished 2nd in 2016 and 1st in 2015 at the American venue. We also won the "Most Innovative Vehicle Award" based on innovation, safety, and mechanical design elegance of our multirotor vehicle concept at the American venue in 2016.
