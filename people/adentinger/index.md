I'm a Computer Science B.Eng. student at Polytechnique Montr√©al. I plan on graduating in December 2019.

I especially enjoy working on a team, seeing the results of my hard work and learning about technologies I hadn't heard of before. I sometimes work on personal projects on my free time, which has allowed me to familiarize with --or sometimes learn-- various technologies such as [CMake][1], [Flash applications][2], [Jenkins][3], [Gerrit][4], [Flex][5] and [Bison][6].

## + Current Projects

- I'm working on [BittyBuzz][7], which is an implementation of the [Buzz programming language][8] for microcontrollers. This will allow researchers to perform swarm robotics experiments on large swarms of cheap robots without the need to re-implement swarm-related features. Possible long-term applications include nanorobotics. MISTLab wishes BittyBuzz, if possible, to fit on the ATMega328P microcontroller of a kilobot. The main constraints of this project are the the program space (32KB, including bootloading program) and the RAM size (2KB). For this project, I work with another Computer Science B.Eng. student, Emir K. Belhaddad.

## + Scholarship

- For the BittyBuzz project, I was chosen as recipient of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)'s [Undergraduate Student Research Award][9] (USRA).
