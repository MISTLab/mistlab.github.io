# + Fang Wu

I received my Ph.D degree in Mechanical Engineer from Nanyang Technological Univerisity in Singapore in 2014. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, Canada). My research interests include multi-robot navigation, low power solution for proximity sensor and coordination of multiple robots, magnetic-field-based motion sensing, inverse problem in sensing and imaging applications. 

## + Current Projects

Currently I am collaborating with a group of researchers and industrial experts to develop an IoT platform for humanitarian aid. My work will focus on multi-robot perception and navigation, also collision avoidance between multiple robots.
