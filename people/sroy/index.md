# Simon Roy

I received my Bachelor's degree with honors in Software Engineering from École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) in Montreal, Canada in December 2024. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in computer engineering at Polytechnique Montréal and MILA under the supervision of Professor Giovanni Beltrame. I'm interested in autonomous robotics and space exploration.

## Current Projects

**LLM-Driven Mission Planning** :
Exploring how large language models can translate high-level objectives into structured, adaptive task sequences for autonomous robots under real-world constraints.

**Precision Landing for Aerial Robotics** :
Developing vision-based, markerless algorithms that enable drones to identify, track, and land on arbitrary targets with sub-meter accuracy.

**Latent-Space World Modeling** :
Training compact, learned representations of environmental dynamics to predict future states and guide real-time planning and decision-making.
