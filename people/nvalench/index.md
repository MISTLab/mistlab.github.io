I am a double degree student currently working towards my M.Sc in computer science at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (Montréal, QC, CANADA). My partner school is *UTC (Université de Technologie de Compiègne)* (Compiègne, FRANCE), where I studied computer science, specialized in real time and embedded systems. Before that I was a mathematics and physics student in preparatory class for high scientific school at *Lycée Janson de Sailly* (Paris, FRANCE).

## + Current Projects
- Developing a embedded system capable of acquiring electrical brain signal during night, in order to detect and stimulate a kind of oscillation (sleep spindle) that plays an important role in memory consolidation. The challenge of this project is to detect those oscillations in real time, at the very beginning of it, in order to send the stimuli as fast as possible. It is done in collaboration with Hugo Jourde (PhD Student) at the *CLASP Laboratory at Concordia University* (Montréal, QC, CANADA), and it could be used by others in order to have a better understanding of the sleep spindle's involvement in memory consolidation.
- I am currently lab instructor for a course on programable logic system at *École Polytechnique de Montréal* (ELE3311)
