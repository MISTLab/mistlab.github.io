# + Majda Moussa

I recieved my computer science engineering degree from the National School of Engineers at Tunis (Tunis, Tunisia) in 2012. My engineering graduation project has been elabored in the Braunschweig  Unversity of technology in Germany.  In 2014, I have got a M.Sc. degree in computer science from  École Polytechnique de Montréal (Montréal, Canada). Currently, I am a Ph.D. student  at École polytechnique de Montréal under the supervision of Prof. Giovanni Beltrame, Prof. Giuliano Antoniol and Prof. Massimiliano di Penta of the University of Sanio. My Research interests include Mobile plateforms, Machine learning, data mining, social media mining and testing.


## + Current Projects

- My doctoral research is focused on ** Android evolution and testing **:
My Ph.D research focuses on search privacy of Android applications and social media. Moreover, we are interested in studing the Android plateform evolution and its impact on Android apps security and developpement.

## + Previous Projects

- My master research has focused on ** Formal verification of a computer network using Model checking and controler synthesis **
The main objective of this work was to introduce automated solutions capable to detect firewall configuration inconsistencies and to check and ensure the inter-firewalls consistency over a computer network . We have proposed a formal modeling and verification framework based on model checking and controller synthesis. It allows to verify and configure automatically the end-to-end security behavior of a set of firewalls w.r.t. a global security policy. To deal with state explosion problem, diffrent models are proposed and evaluated in term of space and time complexity, according to the network size and connectivity rate.

- My graduation engineering project has focused on ** DVB-T chain signal enhancement **
During the intership, I have elaborated a theoretical study for forward error coding schemes applied in DVB-T system, namely convolution code and Reed-Solomon code. I have learned to use the simulation tool Cocentric System Studio and the existing simulation chain for DVB-T. To enhance the DVB-T chain, I implemented  a new approach as function blocks in Cocentric System Studio and integrated them into the existing simulation chain. Through intensive computer simulation, I investigated and evaluated the influences of changing the operational parameters on the performance of the proposed approach in the Dynamic Broadcast system which was a new generation of broadcasting systems proposed  at the institute.

## + Scholarship and Awards

- By the end of 2011, I have recieved a grant for an internship in Braunschweig University of technology in Germany.
- In 2012, I was the laureate of the National scholarship of Tunisia for Master and Ph.D studies in Canada (2012 to 2017).
