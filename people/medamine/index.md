I received my engineer diploma in Electronics and Industrial Computing from Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquées, 
Morocco in 2013. Currently, I am preparing a Master Degree in Avionics and Control at Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal. 
I have joined Mistlab in order to contribute on improving drones on-board computer capacities.

# + Current Projects
My short term mission is to find a better way to implement SFM (Structure From Motion) algorithms by using GPU 
calculation capacities. I’am working specifically on Nvidia TX1 development board.
