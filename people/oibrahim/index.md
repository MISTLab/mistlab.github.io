# + Olfat I. El-Mahi

I graduated from Faculty of Science on 2003 as the first on my class with an Honours Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering. I then win a scholarship from the Egyptian ministry of telecommunication for six month training program to improve my programming and Networking  skills. Later I started as researcher assistant  in City for scientific research institute i worked there until 2009. during this period i was involved in more then on project and gained experience on coding with C++ and open source codes. i proved myself until i became team leader for the last project i evolved with.  The project used 3D laser scanner which I trained on in Australia at maptek Company. The project aim is to document and archive the Ancient Egyptian Antiquities and make a lot of studies in order to maintain it” a Documentary movie is now made by discovery channel about this subject”.At the same time I finished my master studies on 2008. In my master thesis i was interesting in work in Distributed Virtual Environments. I proposed a new method to improve DVE performance using Data Mining. for the experimental part i build my own application using High level Architecture (HLA) Protocol and OpenGL Performer using OpenGL Performer. I also have my fair share of teaching and supervising under graduate students projects on my field. Later i recived a scholarship to finish my Phd studies at ecole Polytechnique de Montreal in Embedded systems and system verification.

## + Current Projects

- My doctoral research is focused on **Embedded System Verification Through Constraint-Based Scheduling**:
Verification has become one of the main bottlenecks in the design process of embedded systems, particularly for Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs). Efficiently proving the correctness of a design is of extreme importance to reduce cost and time-to-market. Simulation is a common
verification method, but complex systems usually require long simulation times. This work advocates Constraint Programming
(CP) as a powerful tool for the verification of performance metrics of MPSoCs.
