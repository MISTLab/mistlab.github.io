Hello World,
I'm studiying Photonics and Computer Vision at the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences, Germany. There I also received my B.Sc. in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Physical Measurement Techniques (IPM). There I worked with LiDAR-Sensors and this sparked my interest in 3D measurement and perception. After that I worked at the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research, where I learned to use neural networks.
My topics of interest include *computer vision, machine learning, 3D perception and data processing, mobile robotics, autonomous systems*.

## + Previous activities
- **Research Assistant at Fraunhofer IGD**: Developed of a initial pose estimation for Augmented Reality applications by training a CNN on rendered CAD data.

- **Bachelor's Thesis at Fraunhofer IPM**: Developed a new method for calibrating Multi-Sensor-Systems (2D-LiDAR with cameras) using a laser tracker. This method produces results with 10x the accuracy of previous methods (0.1 mm / 0.5 mrad STD).


## + Current Projects
- **Master's Thesis at MIST Lab**: Training a CNN in a simulator to avoid obstacles in real life (more info soon ...)
