# + David St-Onge

David St-Onge holds a PhD in mechanical engineering, space robotics, from the University Laval, Canada supervised by [Prof. Clément Gosselin]. His masters degree from the [Robotics Laboratory of University Laval] on the modelling and robust control of a cubic blimp was followed by a FRQNT-Team grant for which he then coordinated three universities’ collaborative efforts. In between these diplomas, he worked 7 years in the field of arts (theater, museums and circus). He was the production director of the Prisme 3 stage set workshop, then a development engineer for a media art Montreal-based production company and a freelance engineer for visual and performing artists. Out of interest he also completed a master in project management at [ESG UQAM] and a certificate in Russian studies at University Laval. He authored more than 20 peer-reviewed publication in the field of robotics. Since 2016, he is a post-doctoral researcher at [MIST], a robotics laboratory at [École Polytechnique de Montréal] under the supervision of [Prof. Giovanni Beltrame].
