If you have a passion for space applications, and you are a hardware
or software wizard (or you are very willing to learn), drop us a line
at join@mistlab.ca. We often have positions available for PhD and
Master's studies in computer engineering, and we are most likely
looking for interns. We always welcome spontaneous applications,
whether you want to get a PhD degree or just work on a project.

If you have read this far and you think your and our expectations
meet, send us an email at join@mistlab.ca with the following:

- A full curriculum vitae
- Your transcripts
- A short paper written in English answering the following questions (200 to 500 words each):
   - Why do you want to do research?
   - What are your research interests?
   - What was your best learning experience?
   - What is your favorite project or technology?
   - (If you are applying for a specific position) How do you think you can contribute to the project?
- The names and contact information for two references
- (Optional) Links to any of your projects/activities

There is no "right" answer to these questions, use this paper as an
opportunity to better present yourself, your interests, and your
skills. Since this paper can very well represent your unique
situation, please try to avoid vague or canned responses, and show
your true value outside of your CV.

We will try to get back to you as soon as possible (you know how
academics sometimes are rather busy), whether you are a match or not
with our lab, and provide feedback that could be useful for your
future applications. If a match appears to be present, we will contact
you to schedule an interview and discuss further steps.
